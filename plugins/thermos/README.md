# Thermos plugin

Cursor's thermo-nuclear review workflow ported to Claude Code and Codex-like harnesses: paired risk and maintainability review passes synthesized into one findings-first verdict.

This tree is a **single common core served to multiple agent harnesses** (Claude Code and Codex-like harnesses) through thin per-harness adapter files. Each harness reads only its own manifest and ignores the other's files, so the shared skills stay authored once.

## Adapter boundary

| Concern | Claude Code | Codex-like |
|:--------|:------------|:-----------|
| Manifest | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` |
| Skills | auto-discovered from `skills/` | declared via `"skills": "./skills/"` |
| Review subagents | auto-discovered from `agents/*.md` | root `agents/*.md` not consumed; use native/generic subagent dispatch when available |
| Per-skill interface | not consumed | `skills/<name>/agents/openai.yaml` |
| Marketplace | repo-root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` |

The Claude manifest deliberately carries **no** `agents`/`skills` path overrides: a directory-string override for `agents` fails `claude plugin validate`, and default auto-discovery of `skills/` and `agents/` already covers both. The Codex manifest declares only `skills` plus its `interface` block, so Codex never loads the root `agents/` as plugin components. That is separate from Codex's harness-level subagent support: when generic/native subagent dispatch is available, the shared `thermos` skill can use it.

"Authored once" does not mean strictly harness-neutral: the shared `thermos` skill names the Claude subagents for conditional dispatch, describes the generic/native subagent branch for Codex-like harnesses, and each skill directory carries a Codex-only `agents/openai.yaml`. The harness-conditional lines live in the shared file on purpose — one inline branch beats diverging per-harness skill bodies.

### Two directories named `agents/`

The tree contains two unrelated things both named `agents/`, at different depths — a collision imposed by the two harness formats, **not renamable** without breaking discovery:

- `agents/*.md` (plugin root) — Claude dispatchable **subagents**. Shared source; only Claude discovers them.
- `skills/<name>/agents/openai.yaml` (nested) — Codex per-skill **interface metadata** (display name, default prompt). Tiny, and consumed only by Codex.

When editing "the agents," confirm which of the two you mean.

On Claude the `thermos` orchestrator dispatches the two named subagents in parallel; each applies its shared skill rubric to the same scoped diff. On Codex-like harnesses with generic/native subagent dispatch, `thermos` uses two generic reviewer subagents instead. Sequential in-context passes are the fallback only when subagent dispatch is unavailable.

## Components

### Skills (shared)

| Skill | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| `thermo-nuclear-review` | Deep branch audit: bugs, breakages, security, devex regressions, feature-gate leaks. |
| `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` | Strict maintainability audit: code-judo, file-size pressure, spaghetti, boundaries. |
| `thermos` | Run both passes and synthesize deduplicated, severity-ordered findings. |

### Subagents (Claude-discovered)

| Subagent | Purpose |
|:---------|:--------|
| `thermo-nuclear-review-subagent` | Dispatchable wrapper that applies the `thermo-nuclear-review` rubric to a scoped diff. |
| `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review-subagent` | Dispatchable wrapper that applies the `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` rubric to a scoped diff. |

## Maintenance notes

- **Keep the two manifest `description` fields paired.** They differ only by the `for Codex` qualifier and the omission of the `parallel review subagents` clause because the root `agents/*.md` wrappers are Claude-only plugin components. Codex can still use native/generic subagent dispatch when the harness exposes it. Mirror any other wording change across both.
- **Keep the Codex default prompts paired.** Each entry in the Codex manifest's `interface.defaultPrompt` duplicates a per-skill `skills/<name>/agents/openai.yaml` `default_prompt` on a second Codex surface; keep each pair verbatim-identical.
- **Scope enumerations are paraphrases, not pairs.** The review-dimension lists in the skill descriptions, the `thermos` routing step, the subagent descriptions, and the Components tables above are intentionally loose restatements for their own surfaces. Keep each accurate; do not sync them verbatim.
- **Treat review inputs as untrusted evidence.** The orchestrator must include this boundary in every dispatch, and every directly invocable review skill and Claude subagent repeats it so no harness path depends on another component having loaded first.
- **Validate cross-harness contracts.** From the repository root, run `python3 scripts/validate_thermos.py`. It checks paired manifest versions and descriptions, Codex default prompts, the supported component inventory, review-input boundaries, and orchestration contracts without third-party dependencies.
- **Versioning.** Both manifests use semver build metadata (`<semver>+claude.<ts>`, `<semver>+codex.<ts>`) to disambiguate the artifacts. Build metadata after `+` does not affect version precedence, so a real release that should trigger an update check must bump `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (or use a pre-release identifier before the `+`) — a new timestamp alone reads as the same version.
- **Codex installs are cached copies.** Codex reads the local marketplace source when installing, validates the Codex manifest and declared skill surface, and writes a copied cache under `~/.codex/plugins/cache/`. Source edits need a fresh Codex build-metadata cachebuster, `codex plugin add thermos@nisavid-agents`, and a new Codex thread. The cache may include root Claude files and docs copied from the source tree, but the Codex runtime component surface remains the Codex-declared surface: `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `skills/`, nested `skills/<name>/agents/openai.yaml`, referenced skill files, and shared assets.
- **Claude installs are cached copies.** First-time install: `claude plugin marketplace add nisavid/agents` (or the local checkout path), then install `thermos` from the `nisavid-agents` marketplace. After editing this tree, run `claude plugin marketplace update nisavid-agents` and update/reinstall the plugin; the running session needs a restart to pick up a new plugin version.
- **Attribution.** Both manifests attribute this diverged port to its maintainer and point at this repository. Upstream Cursor credit lives in the [Upstream](#upstream) section and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); the Codex manifest uses only fields accepted by Codex validation.
